I created a variation of the Forward Digit Span Task (https://www.cambridgecognition.com/cantab/cognitive-tests/memory/digit-span-dgs/) in R Shiny.

The FDST is a common method used to measure the span of the working memory in the field of Cognitive Psychology.

This was purely an exercise for fun and you should not use this for any rigorous assessments, research studies or for profit!
